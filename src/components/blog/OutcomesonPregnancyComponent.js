                                <p className="tooth-decay-font">1) Medical experts recommend that working on laptops or usage of gadgets can be harmful to pregnant women. They should increase the distance between self & the source of radiation by avoiding keeping the electrical devices directly near your body

                                    2) Moreover, airplane mode on the phone is effective during naps. The effective utilization of electronic gadgets involves limiting laptop & computer usage to less than four hours at a stretch

                                    3) A baby growing in the womb needs good nutrition, along with great<a className="tag-color" href="how-to-get-a-healthy-mind"> maternal health.</a>

                                    Although the radiation emitted by phones, desktops, laptops or tablets has low, but frequent & long-lasting exposure to these devices can cause severe health issues in pregnant women & their growing babies. It is hence advised to take preventive measures during this period and make sure to increase the distance between self & the source of radiation is necessary for the body.
