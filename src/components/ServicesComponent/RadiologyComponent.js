                                    An X-ray is a common imaging test that’s been used for decades. It can help your doctor view the inside of your body without having to make an incision. This can help them diagnose, monitor, and treat many medical conditions.
                                    Your doctor may order an X-ray to:
                                <li>examine an area where you’re experiencing pain or discomfort</li>
                                    <li>monitor the progression of a diagnosed disease, such as osteoporosis</li>

                                    An X-ray can be used to examine almost any part of the body & for examinations such as X-ray ankle, X-ray abdomen, X-ray forearm, X-ray hand, X-ray both heel, X-ray hip, X-ray knee, X-ray leg, X-ray both legs, etc.

                                    An ultrasound scan is a medical test that uses high-frequency sound waves to capture live images from the inside of your body. It's also known as sonography.<br></br>
                                    An ultrasound allows your doctor to see problems with organs, vessels, and tissues without needing to make an incision. Doctors use ultrasound imaging to help diagnose conditions affecting the organs and soft tissues of the body, including for tests such as:<br></br>
                                    USG abdomen, USG liver, USG both kidneys, USG heart, USG level 1, USG level 2, USG neck, USG breast, USG scrotum, USG ankle joint, USG knee joint, USG left wrist, USG right wrist etc.

                                    A Doppler ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to show blood moving through blood vessels. Your doctor may suggest a Doppler ultrasound exam if you show signs of decreased blood flow in the arteries or veins of your legs, arms, or neck. It is used for examinations such as: Doppler abdominal, Doppler arterial - one limb, Doppler arterial / venous - one limb, Doppler both limbs arterial, Doppler both limbs venous, Doppler both limbs arterial/venous (one study), Doppler both lower limbs arterial & venous, Doppler both upper limbs arterial & venous, Doppler carotid, Doppler obstetric, Doppler obstetric with bpp, Doppler pelvic, Doppler penile, Doppler peripheral arterial, Doppler peripheral venous, Doppler renal, Doppler scrotal, Doppler single limb arterial & venous, &Doppler small parts.
